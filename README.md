**How to Run**

To run:
- Clone project
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm run dev

**Additional Libraries**
The only additional library used is React Icons, which is simply used for the icons in the buttons throughout the application.

**Challenges**
Certainly the biggest challenge that I faced was towards the end, in allowing a user to view the emojis within the input as they type them. Though I unfortunately wasn't able to accomplish this within the time constraints, I absolutely feel confident that I could given more time. The user is still able to view the emojis in the chat itself, here the content doesn't also need to manage an input, only display. Another interesting problem that I didn't realize I'd encounter is the use of pseudoelements combined with Tailwind. Particularly, this was necessary for the hover over input widening the border, without an actual border affecting the layout of any neighboring components. I was able to implement this, and learned more about how to interact with pseudoelements through Tailwind in doing so. This is an area I'd like to learn more about. Overall, I felt appropriately challenged by this project, however I feel confident in my execution of its key compoonents.
